  - title: Computer-Aided Synthesis Planning
    company: advised by [_Prof. Yiming Mo_](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yimingmo) from [Zhejiang University Mo Research Lab](http://www.mo-group.cn/)
    company_url: 'http://www.mo-group.cn/'
    company_logo: zju
    location: Working Remotely

        Retrosynthetic analysis is the way that organic chemists draw an imaginary line from a target molecule to available precursors. Can a computer act as a chemist to do this work? To get the answer on my own, I constructed the model of retrosynthesis based on molecular similarity, with the top-50 exact matching accuracy of 80.86%.

  - title: Magnesium-Air Battery Based on Dual-Layer Gel Electrolyte
    company: advised by [_Prof. Yanna Nuli_](https://scce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/jiaoshi.php?aid=112&c=3) from SJTU Electrochemistry and Energy Technology Institute
    location: Shanghai, China
    # company_url: 'https://scce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/'

    date_start: '2021-12-01'
    date_end: '2022-06-01'

        Mg-air batteries are explored as the next-generation power systems for wearable and implantable electronics. However, high corrosion rate and low utilization of Mg anode largely impair the performance. In this work, I made Mg-air batteries based on dual-layer gel electrolyte to mitigate the above two problems by preventing the corrosion of Mg anode and the production of dense passive layer.


  - title: The Optimization of an Automatic Platform for Microflow Synthesis
    company: advised by [_Prof. Yuanhai Su_](https://scce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/jiaoshi.php?aid=444&c=2) from SJTU Continuous-Flow Reactor Technology Research Group
    location: Shanghai, China
    # company_url: 'https://scce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/'
    company_logo: sjtu
    date_start: '2021-08-01'
    # date_end: '2022-08-01'
    description: |2-
        Automated synthesis is more economical and time-saving than traditional manual-based approaches. In this work, we operated an automatic platform for the photoisomerization of norbornadiene to quadricyclanee, and optimized the structure of the photomicroreactor and the gas chromatographic analysis on this platform.

  - title: Investigation on Covalent Modification of Black Phosphorus
    company: advised by [_Prof. Gang Liu_](https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/6764-2/) from SJTU Brain-Inspired and Smart Bionic Device Lab
    # company_url: 'https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/'
    company_logo: sjtu
    location: Shanghai, China
    date_start: '2020-08-01'
    date_end: '2021-08-01'
    description: |2-
        Black phosphorus (BP) is a novel layered semiconducting material, which has broad prospects in optoelectronics and nanoelectronics, especially in the construction of Resistive random access memories (RRAMs). However, the BP nanosheets (BPNSs) can be easily oxidized, losing semiconductor properties. Here, we focused on the covalent modification of BPNSs, and constructed a RRAM which exhibited an excellent performance, providing a new idea for building high-performance computers in the future .
