I am Xu Huang (黄旭), a final year undergraduate from Shanghai Jiao Tong university (SJTU) majoring in Chemical Engineering and Technology.

My research interest lies on the cheminformatics, which uses information technology to promote the development of chemistry, material science and chemical engineering.

I am curious about topics such as computered-aided synthesis planning, drug discovery via artificial intelligence, catalyst design with machine learning and so on.
